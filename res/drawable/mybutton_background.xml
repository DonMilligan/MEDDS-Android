<!-- In order to give the user an easy indicator that their action has done something 
in the program having the button change based on actions does this very efficiently.
The selector bellow has 4 items that change the picture based on the users current action -->
<selector

<!-- If the user is highlighting the button but has not pressed it  a focus image is displayed. 
as you can see bellow the android state_pressed is not true but the focus is.   -->
<item
 android:state_focused="true"
 android:state_pressed="false"
 android:drawable="@drawable/focus" />

<!-- While the user is clicking the button including holding it in 
the color is changed to a solid green -->
<item
 android:state_focused="true"
 android:state_pressed="true"
 android:drawable="@drawable/green" />

<!-- This ensures that if a user is pressing more then one button they will still light up
green even without focus -->
<item
 android:state_focused="false"
 android:state_pressed="true"
 android:drawable="@drawable/green" />

<!-- If an item is not being clicked or focused then it is red -->
